# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my **DSA in C++** repository! ðŸš€ This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**.

## ðŸ“Œ About
This repository contains my solutions and implementations of various **DSA concepts** in C++. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen C++ fundamentals, and prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following:
- A C++ compiler (G++/Clang/MSVC)
- A basic understanding of C++ syntax
- An IDE (VS Code, CLion, CodeBlocks, etc.) or terminal

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered
This repository covers the following topics:
- Basics of C++ (Syntax, Functions, OOPs, STL, etc.)
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stack and Queue
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs and Trees
- Advanced DSA Concepts

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Cpp
   ```
3. Compile and run a program:
   ```bash
   g++ basics/example.cpp -o example
   ./example
   ```
